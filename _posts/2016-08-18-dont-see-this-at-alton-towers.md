# Don't see this at Alton Towers
![Even Death has to have some fun... (my photo of the inner sleeve from Michael Moorcock and the Deep Fix album New Worlds Fair)](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/0d32e70f-d36a-4d8c-9638-ab715e10ac04.jpg)

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death... or, as it happens, the new worlds fair where death rides a carousel.
